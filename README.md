For API documentation, refer to: [DAB API Docs](https://github.com/sixnine-dotdev/dab-api-docs)

## Privacy Notice

**Location Permission**: Windows may show that BeatBoss is requesting location access. This is a side effect of the Flet UI framework (which uses a browser engine internally) and **not** something our app uses or needs. 

- **The app does NOT collect, use, or transmit your location**
- You can safely deny this permission - it won't affect app functionality
- The source code is fully open and contains zero geolocation API calls
- This is a known limitation of Flet-based desktop applications
